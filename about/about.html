                Established in 1997, Winning Smile Dental, Orthodontics & Cosmetics was founded by Kevin O'Brien and has gone on to become a leading clinic that knows its customers needs. We recognise that some patients may be apprehensive, and that a visit to a dentist
                can be a daunting prospect. We hope that our relaxed and friendly approach in our comfortable surroundings will alleviate any anxiety you may have. Establishing rewarding and lasting relationships with our patients is important to us.
                We pledge excellence in all we do, and we are looking forward to helping you make the most of your smile now and for all the years to come. Our goal is prevention rather than treatment.

                            I was nervous and immediately put me at ease. The experience was a very positive one. Kevin made me feel secure and happy, the procedure was quick and pain free. I was delighted with the results"</div>
                        <div class="box">Jennifer Cork - "My family and I have been attending Winning Smiles Dental Practice for the last 6 years. Through out this time we always found the staff to be extremely polite, efficient and helpful. Kevin has always been very
                            professional in his approach to us yet friendly and reassuring, especially towards our younger children who enjoy going for their check ups! I would highly recommend this practise to anyone."</div>

                            I am not a client of theirs I was seen the following day. The dentist was great, he put my mind at ease and had the procedure completed in 30 minutes. I am very satisfied with the outcome."</div>

                            Lynda to the professional service provided by Grace, I felt like I was in the best hand from start to finish! The facility was spotlessly clean, plenty of parking and very convenient opening hours. Cannot recommend enough."</div>
