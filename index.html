						The following protocol will help to keep you and us safe:<br>

						Patients are triaged over phone first to see if any symptoms have been noted in the past 48 hrs or if they have been in contact with anyone with Covid 19.<br><br>
						
						Appointment day:<br>

						- Please attend at your appointed time as we will try to ensure that there are as few people as possible in the practice on an hour to hour basis, 
							if you wish to wait outside and only come in when we are ready to see you please feel free to notify 
							the practice of same and we will message you when we are ready to take you directly into the surgery.<br><br>
						- We will create scheduled breaks between appointments to reduce patient to patient contact as much as possible and we ask that you would attend on your own for your appointment and avoid bringing friends and family with you
							patient proceeds into waiting area. Patients will be required to observe social distancing in waiting rooms and therefore may be asked to be seated in different parts of the building.<br><br>
						
						Patient called to surgery:<br>
						
							- Aerosol generating procedures will be kept to a minimum<br>
							- Both high volume aspirators used if high speed drill used.<br>
							- Rubber dam is used where possible and necessary.<br>
